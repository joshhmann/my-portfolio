# Personal Portfolio

This repository contains my personal portfolio built with [Svelte](https://svelte.dev/). It showcases my projects, work experience and a simple contact form.

## Installation

1. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```
2. Start a development server with live reloading:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```
3. Build for production:
   ```bash
   npm run build
   ```
4. Serve the built files locally to verify the production build:
   ```bash
   npm run start
   ```

## Deployment

Upload the contents of the `public` folder to your preferred static hosting provider (for example, Netlify or GitHub Pages).
